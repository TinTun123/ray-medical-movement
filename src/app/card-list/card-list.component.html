            <h5>Founding of RAY : Medical Movement </h5>
            <p>
                After the military coup on 1st February 2021, the people in Myanmar expressed non-violent protests. Nevertheless,
                the military junta used brutal control measures and violent crack down upon non-violent protestors. Traumatized patients canâ€™t receive proper medical treatments. 
                 Medical professionals, facilities and patients came under attack. Some died and some had to flee away.
